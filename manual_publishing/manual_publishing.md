# 📅 Manual Publishing

If I could recommend anyone to do something when building a report, it would be to setup this **Publishing Setting**
As there is nothing more hectic than stakeholders use your reports when you are still fixing them.


## 🛠️ Steps
1. Go to File
2. Select **Publishing settings**
3. Turn on manual report publishing
4. Your report is ready!!
