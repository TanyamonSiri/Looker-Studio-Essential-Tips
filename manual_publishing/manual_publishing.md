# 📅 Manual Publishing

One of the most important settings I recommend when building reports is enabling **Publishing Settings**.  
This prevents stakeholders from seeing unfinished updates while you are still making changes.  

## 🛠️ Steps

1. Go to **File**.  
2. Select **Publishing settings**.

3. Turn on **Manual report publishing** and click **Save**.

4. Your report is now ready with manual publishing enabled.  

   A new button will appear next to the report name.

   Once you finish editing your report and want to make the changes visible to users, simply click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of the page.
