# üìÖ Parameter Date Filters & Slicers

In many projects, I‚Äôve often encountered a common challenge: different stakeholders require sales data at different levels of date granularity.

For example:

- The **Finance** team typically prefers a **monthly** sales view for financial reporting.
- The **Marketing** team, on the other hand, often needs **daily** or **weekly** breakdowns to evaluate campaign performance in detail.

To meet these varied needs, some data analysts create **separate reports** for each team or split date granularities across different pages. While this approach may work in the short term, it leads to:

- Unnecessary **report duplication**
- Increased **maintenance overhead**
- Higher **resource consumption**

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use a Date Granularity Parameter

A better approach is to implement **parameterized date filters**. By using a parameter, you can dynamically control the date granularity across your dashboards without duplicating reports.

This technique allows users to **switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views** using a single report interface, improving both usability and maintainability.

You can apply this method in:

- **Looker Studio**
- **Power BI**
- **Tableau**
- Or any modern BI tool that supports parameters and dynamic filtering.

> üí° **Tip**: Although this guide is focused on Looker Studio, the concept of parameter-driven filtering is applicable across most BI platforms.
 

## üìÅ Sample Data

- [mockup_demand_sales.csv](https://github.com/TanyamonSiri/Looker-Studio-Essential-Tips/blob/main/parameter_date_filter/mockup_demand_sales_data.csv)

## üìå Data Requirement

To use this technique, your dataset must include the following:

- `date`: Must be in a **date data type**, not text or string.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure the `date` column is correctly recognized as a date field in your BI tool (e.g., Looker Studio). If it's stored as text, convert it to a proper date format to enable correct filtering and parameter usage.


## Steps
### <b> 1. Create Parameter in Looker Studio </b> <br>
In Looker Studio, you have to firstly create a parameter of all granularities you need.<br>
In the picture below, you can see that I created a list of values including `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`, `Quarterly`, and `Yearly (CY)`. <br>
I named this parameter as 'Date Level'

### <b> 2. Create a new Calculation field </b> <br>
In this step, you will need to create a calculated field to link with the 'Date Level' parameter. <br>
My data has `order_date` as a date dimension so I used simple `CASE WHEN` in this case:

``` sql
CASE
  WHEN  LOWER(   Date Level) = 'daily' THEN FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y-%m-%d", order_date)
  WHEN LOWER(  Date Level) = 'weekly' THEN
           FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y-%m-%d",
                  DATETIME_TRUNC(order_date, ISOWEEK)) || ' to ' || FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y-%m-%d", DATETIME_ADD(DATETIME_TRUNC(order_date, ISOWEEK), INTERVAL 6 DAY) )
  WHEN LOWER ( Date Level) = 'monthly' THEN FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y%m", order_date)
  WHEN LOWER(  Date Level) = 'quarterly' THEN FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y", order_date) || 'Q' || QUARTER(order_date)
  WHEN LOWER(  Date Level) = 'yearly (cy)' THEN FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y", order_date)
END
 
```

In this case, I used an `ISO week` which has monday as a week start day üòä

### <b> 3. Use your new Calculation field in visuals </b> <br>
In this step, I have already created a pivot table as shown in the picture below. <br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c902016-66fa-44b9-a8d7-46bbd3139ecc)


But I have not changed my `order_date` to `Date Level Selection` yet, so let's change it.
At <b> Row dimension</b> section, select `Date Level Selection`.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ac13722-91e7-4392-98c7-a371f7a6816f)

Now my table has calculated field that connecting to `Date Level` parameter.
When users want to view monthly sales of each product, they can simply select 'Monthly' in `Date Level` parameter.

<ins> Monthly View: </ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f348718b-cf59-4cf8-a54a-76ddab311b05)

<ins> Quarterly View: </ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc9c7fb-ca1b-4f1b-9881-abdf28ce4ef8)

Notice that even though the calculated field's type is text, the table shows sales data in a correct order.

### <b> 4. Enhance your report </b> <br>
Since, parameter date filter and calculated field are not limited to only table, in this case I created a stacked bar chart.  <br>

<ins> Monthly View: </ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c2e6ef2-397d-44bd-81d7-d99e7b2669fe)

<ins> Quarterly View: </ins>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/828e6a92-bf1f-4eae-93fa-608ac45350e8)


Now anyone can freely select the `date level` and both charts would change spontanously üçæüòä 

## Summary
Eventhough not all charts type are suitable for every date dimension. <br>
By combining Parameter Date Filters and Calculated Field, report users can freely manipulate their data and select the view that suiting with their needs.
