# üìà Track Report Usage with GA4

Unlike Power BI or Tableau, which include built-in usage metrics, **Looker Studio** does not provide native tracking inside the workspace.  
To monitor report usage, you need to integrate with **GA4 (Google Analytics 4)**.

## Why Usage Tracking Matters  

Building dashboards is always an **iterative process**.  
User needs can shift as business rules and priorities change. Without usage data, it‚Äôs impossible to know whether the reports we publish are:  
- Being accessed by the intended audience  
- Delivering value in line with current business requirements  

Tracking usage helps you validate whether your dashboard is actually serving its purpose.

### Example 1: Refresh Requirements  

Imagine stakeholders request a dashboard that refreshes **every 4 hours** to monitor a newly launched campaign.  

A project manager will eventually ask:  
- *‚ÄúIs this refresh interval still required?‚Äù*  
- *‚ÄúAre users actively checking the report every 4 hours?‚Äù*  

If we cannot measure usage, we won‚Äôt know whether the effort invested in maintaining such a refresh schedule is justified.

### Example 2: Changing Business Context  

Suppose you build a dashboard to track:  
- The number of emails sent to applicants  
- Compared against the number of applications received  

The email campaigns are scheduled to send weekly. But due to a technical issue, the emails **fail to send**. The responsible team notices a week later.  

In this scenario:  
- The dashboard no longer reflects reality  
- The business continues to incur maintenance cost for a dashboard that doesn‚Äôt meet its intended purpose

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Enable GA4 Tracking in Looker Studio

1. **Create a GA4 Property**  
   - Go to Google Analytics (https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/).
   - In **Google Analytics**, go to the **Admin** page and create a **new Account** if you do not already have one. This will give you a fresh space to create properties and data streams for tracking Looker Studio report usage.

   - Follow the step to the Data Collection step:

     Click the new stream we created:

2. **Get the Measurement ID**  
   - Navigate to the Web Stream detail and copy the **Measurement ID** (e.g., `G-XXXXXXX`).

3. **Open Your Looker Studio Report**  
   - Go to your report and select **File ‚Üí Report settings**.  

4. **Enable GA4 Tracking**  
   - In the settings panel, paste your **Measurement ID** into the Google Analytics tracking field.

5. **Publish the Report**  
   - Once enabled, GA4 will start recording report usage events (e.g., page views, sessions).  

6. **Validate in GA4**  
   - Go to GA4‚Äôs **Realtime Report** to confirm events are being logged as users view the report.

## Key Takeaway  

Every dashboard comes with a cost.  
If a report is **not used** or **no longer aligned** with business needs, it should be adjusted ‚Äî or even retired.  

By integrating GA4 with Looker Studio, you gain visibility into report usage and can make informed decisions about:  
- Which reports deserve continued investment  
- Which ones require updates  
- Which ones should be decommissioned
